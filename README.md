# Streaming Platform

The brief was to create a video streaming platform using data from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/), a movie database and REST API. Includes server-side rendering of data in each category and caching of images.

#### Tech Stack:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
- Icons from [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- Data from [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) REST API
- Styling with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Fully responsive UI with CSS grid and flexbox
